#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Serve a Mineski tool (the folder holding index.html) locally for testing, with caching disabled so
browsers always load the latest files (Python's plain http.server lets browsers keep stale copies) and
with explicit JavaScript types (some Windows machines serve .js as text/plain, and module scripts then
refuse to run).

Copy this file to <tool>/tools/serve.py and set PORT to the tool's port from the registry in
mineski-systems-design (section 8.3); register http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>/ on the Lark app.

    python tools/serve.py          # http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>/
    python tools/serve.py 9200     # another port

Always 127.0.0.1, never "localhost": they are different origins, with different storage and different
redirect URLs on the Lark app.

Two safeguards:
- It refuses to start when the port is already taken, and says so. (Python's server normally asks for
  SO_REUSEADDR, which on Windows lets a second server share a port that's in use; requests then go to
  whichever one Windows picks, often an old one, and the browser gets "didn't send any data".)
- It keeps serving if the window or terminal it was started from goes away. (Each request is logged
  to that console; with the console gone, the log write used to fail and every request got an empty
  answer.)
