# Changelog

Every change and version update of Suppliers, newest first. The version is
`APP.version` in `js/config.js`; the top bar shows it beside the name ("v1.0.0").

**Releasing a change:** bump `APP.version` (semver: patch for fixes, minor for
new features or behaviour, major when people must relearn something or old data
or links stop working), add an entry here with the same number and the date,
and say what changed in the team's words. `npm run check:shell` fails if the
two numbers differ.
